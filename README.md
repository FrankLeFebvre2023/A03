## Part 1: Webstorm Instructions

Webstorm is a useful tool for editing text files and coding projects. It also has a great feature that allows you to easily connect your projects in Webstorm to Github. To do this, you do the following:
1. In Webstorm, create a new project by selecting File > New > Project. After doing this, select Empty Project.
2. To connect to Github, select "VCS" from the top toolbar, then select "Get From Version Control" from the drop down menu. Once you do this, you can either paste the URL of your repository, or select your Github account from the left side and manually pick out your repository.

## Part 2: Glossary of Terms
* **Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of a repository that does not affect the main branch, allowing you to work freely without disrupting the live version.
* **Clone**: A clone is a copy of a repository that is stored locally on your computer. Clone is also the name of the command that facilitates this action.
* **Commit**: A commit is an individual change to one or more files. GitHub assigns individual IDs to all commits so that there is a record of every change made to a project.
* **Fetch**: Fetch is a command that allows you to bring changes from the remote repository, to your local one. Unlike the Pull command, Fetch allows you to review the changes before committing them.
* **GIT**: Written by Linus Torvalds, Git is a program for tracking changes in text files.
* **Github**: Github is a web-based service that uses Git in order to host projects.
* **Merge**: Merge is a command that merges two different branches together. It is used when the changes made to a branch are finalized, and are ready to be added to the main project.
* **Merge Conflict**: A merge conflict occurs when, during the merge process, there are conflicting changes to a particular file. These conflicts are typically solved manually, by having the humans behind the changes decide which version fits the project better. 
* **Push**: The Push command takes commits from the local repository, and adds them to the remote repository.
* **Pull**: Similar to the Fetch command, Pull takes changes from the remote repository, and adds them to your local repository, automatically committing them. Unlike Fetch, you do not get to review the changes before deciding to commit them.
* **Remote**: Remote refers to something that is not on your local device. The repository on Github's website is remote, because it is hosted by Github's web servers, and is not stored on your PC's hard drive.
* **Repository**: A repository is a folder for a project, that hosts all the sub-folders and files for a particular project or purpose.
